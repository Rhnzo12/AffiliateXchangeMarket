                <p>
                  Before initiating any formal dispute resolution, you agree to contact us at legal@affiliatexchange.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. We will work in good faith to resolve disputes within 30 days.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">18.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
                <p>
                  If informal resolution fails, you and AffiliateXchange agree to resolve any disputes through binding arbitration rather than in court, except for:
                </p>

                  Arbitration will be conducted by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services) under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures. The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, California, or remotely via video conference if both parties agree. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.
